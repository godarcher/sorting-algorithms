#! This program uses selection sort to sort an unserted array and prints it to console

"""
? In computer science, selection sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. 
? It has an O(n2) time complexity, which makes it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort. 
? Selection sort is noted for its simplicity and has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms in certain situations, particularly where auxiliary memory is limited.

? The algorithm divides the input list into two parts:
? a sorted sublist of items which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items that occupy the rest of the list. 
? Initially, the sorted sublist is empty and the unsorted sublist is the entire input list. 
? The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging (swapping) it with the leftmost unsorted element 
? (putting it in sorted order), and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right.

? The time efficiency of selection sort is quadratic, so there are a number of sorting techniques which have better time complexity than selection sort. 
? One thing which distinguishes selection sort from other sorting algorithms is that it makes the minimum possible number of swaps, n âˆ’ 1 in the worst case.
