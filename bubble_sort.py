#! This program uses bubble sort to sort an unserted array and prints it to console

"""
? Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list,
? compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.
? The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list.
?
? This simple algorithm performs poorly in real world use and is used primarily as an educational tool. 
? More efficient algorithms such as quicksort, timsort, or merge sort are used by the sorting libraries built into popular programming languages such as Python and Java
?
? Bubble sort has a worst-case and average complexity of О(n2), where n is the number of items being sorted. Most practical sorting algorithms have substantially better 
? worst-case or average complexity, often O(n log n). Even other О(n2) sorting algorithms, such as insertion sort, generally run faster than bubble sort, and are no more complex.
? Therefore, bubble sort is not a practical sorting algorithm.

# * This is the main function for bubble sort
# It takes an array as input and manipules the array for sorted output
